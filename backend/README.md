# Task Management API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing a to-do list, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You also need a running instance of MongoDB.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, you will need to have `nodemon` installed, or you can run the `index.js` file directly with `node`.

To run with `nodemon`:
```bash
nodemon index.js
```

To run with `node`:
```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on port 3100 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to configure the application:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run. Defaults to `3100`.
- `DB_CONN_STR`: The connection string for the MongoDB database. **(Required)**
- `USE_DB_AUTH`: Set to `true` to force database authentication. If omitted, auth is enabled automatically when both `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` are present.
- `DB_USERNAME`: The username for the database. Required only when MongoDB authentication is enabled.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database. Required only when MongoDB authentication is enabled.
- `DB_AUTH_SOURCE`: The MongoDB auth database. Defaults to `admin`.
